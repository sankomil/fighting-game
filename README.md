# Fighting game in JS

This game was created based on the tutorial provided by [Chris Courses on Youtube](https://youtu.be/vyqbNFMDRGQ)

I would like to thank [Clembod](https://clembod.itch.io/) for their sprites. The sprites I have used are [Warrior](https://clembod.itch.io/warrior-free-animation-set) and [Bringer of Death](https://clembod.itch.io/bringer-of-death-free).
